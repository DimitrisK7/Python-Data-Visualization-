<---------SCRAPING,PROCESSING AND VISUALISATION OF DATA PROJECT ---------->

Using python3 and various compatible dependencies to scrape data from an API, process it locally and display it 
in a visually simplistic and easy to understand way. The core of the code can be used with any other
API with a few tweeks.

 The creation of this project was a first try of mine to create a tool to help me understand
the nature of data analysis, how to implement it and how to present data in a useful manner in order to
understand it better.

This is a 2024 re-iteration of my initial project since a lot of dependencies and the API i used previously were not
supported today.
